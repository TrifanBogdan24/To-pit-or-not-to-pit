# üèéÔ∏è To pit or not pit...

A **memory management** CLI app, built in **C**
to analyze sensors data of a Ferrari **Formula 1** car.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Spoiler Alert!
> This is **NOT** a **data acquisition** project.

## Story Telling

In this **fictional scenario in which my project takes place**,
Ferrari engineers needed my software expertise to stay competitive during F1 season.
They discovered that faulty sensors (likely cheap ones from AliExpress üòâ)
were feeding incorrect data into their systems, affecting performance decisions.

**My job was clear**:
develop solutions to detect and eliminate bad data,
ensuring the team works with accurate insights.
By doing so, I played a direct role in helping Ferrari chase victory on the F1 track.

## Sensor Types

In this scenario, there are 2 types of faulty sensors in a Formula 1 car:
1. **PMU** (Power Management Unit) Sensors
2. **Tire** Sensors

Each sensor type has its priority and associated function callss.



## üë®‚Äçüíª Software Commands I Provide to Ferrari Engineers

### 1. Simple Print (`print <index>`)
---

It will the print the data received by the sensor the given index.

In the case of an invalid value, the following error message will appear: `Index not in range!`.


Expected output for **PMU Sensors**:
```
Power Management Unit
Voltage: <voltage>
Current: <current>
Power Consumption: <power_consumption>
Energy Regen: <energy_regen>
Energy Storage: <energy_storage>
```

Expected output for **Tire Sensors**:
```
Tire Sensor
Pressure: <pressure>
Temperature: <temperature>
Wear Level: <wear_level>
Performance Score: <computed score>/Performance Score: Not Calculated
```



### 2. Priority Printing
---

It will show data from all sensors, sorting after their type:
**PMU sensors** are more important than **Tire Sensors**.


### 3. Analyze (`analyze <index>`)
---

It will call the functions associated to the given sensor.

Like **imple print**, the `Index not in range!` will appear if the index is invalid.

### 4. `clear`
---

It will delete mulfunctioning sensor (containing error-prone values) from the array of sensors.


### 5. `exit`
---

Gracefully shut down the program after free-ing the memory.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run the CLI app


```sh
cd src/
make
./main ../checker/input/<sensor-file>.dat < ../checker/input/<command-file>.in
```

Example:

```sh
./main ../checker/input/sensors_print_easy_1.dat < ../checker/input/commands_print_easy_1.in
```

üßπ Don't forget to remove the object and binary files:
```sh
make clean
```


## `>_` User Input

- **Command line argument**: path to the `*.dat` file containing sensors data
  - > Use `sensors_*.dat` from `checker/input/` 
- **Stdandard input**: the *"operations"* to perform on sensors data
  - > Use `commands_*.in` from `checker/input/`

üí° A more elegant solution to run the executable
would be to use **input redirection** (`<`) to provide commands from a file,
as shown in the examples above.




## Data Structures for Sensors



Sensor:
```c
typedef struct {
	enum sensor_type sensor_type;
	void *sensor_data;
	int nr_operations;
	int *operations_idxs;
} sensor;
```


**PMU** sensor data:
```c
typedef struct __attribute__((__packed__)) {
	float voltage;
	float current;
	float power_consumption;
	int energy_regen;
	int energy_storage;
} power_management_unit;
```


**Tire** sensor data:
```c
typedef struct __attribute__((__packed__)) {
	float pressure;
	float temperature;
	int wear_level;
	int performace_score;
} tire_sensor;

```



## üë®‚Äçüíª My Implementation

### Sensor Priority
---


The values of **Power Management Unit** sensors
are more important than those received from **Tyre Sensors**.
Thus, the Ferrari team will want the **PMU** values to be the first in the sensor vector.

We receive the following sensors as input:
```
Tire_1 Tire_2 PMU_1 PMU_2 Tire_3 PMU_3 Tire_4 Tire_5 PMU_4
```

The vector will contain the sensors in the following order:
```
PMU_1 PMU_2 PMU_3 PMU_4 Tire_1 Tire_2 Tire_3 Tire_4 Tire_5
```

### Sorting Sensors
---


When sorting sensors from pointers,
I took into account the fact that order (in which sensors of the same type appear) must be kept.

A sorting method, which I considered to be more appropriate to me and easy to implement,
consists of taking an auxiliary pointer of sensors,
initially empty and **iterating** the sensors (from left to right) **twice**:
1. During the first iteration: I added only the **PMU** sensors to the auxiliary pointer
2. In the second: only those who measure **Tire** parameters/

At the end, I replaced (each element of) the initial pointer(s) with the auxiliary one.

Thus, sorting has a time complexity of `O(2 * N) = O(N)`
where **N** is the total number of sensors.


> üí° Another (*perhaps more efficient method*) would have been a **priority queue**,
> implemented as a *"binary tree"*:
> 1. **PMU** sensors to be in the left branch
> 2. while the **Tire** values in the right

> üéØ Even though more complex methods may exist,
> the one that I choose aligns better with the goals and context of my implementation.


### Analyze Sensors (Function call)
---



**Requirement**: The coresponding sensor functions MUST BE called through the array.

> Under no circumstances the functions can be explicitally called.


In order to do so, I've created a **pointer of eight elements**, **each element pointing to a specific function**.

For the actual call of the function,
I made a **pointer casting** to extract the desired function.
The call is made using the `sensor_data` field of the `sensor` data structure.


```c
scanf("%d", &indice_senzor);
if (ZERO <= indice_senzor && indice_senzor <= nr_total_senzori - UNU) {
    void *functie[OPT];
    get_operations(functie);
    for (int i = ZERO; i < senzor[indice_senzor].nr_operations; i++) {
        // function call (equivalent to f() ) :
        ((void (*)()) functie[senzor[indice_senzor]
            .operations_idxs[i]]) (senzor[indice_senzor]
            .sensor_data);
    }
}
```





## üß™ Automated Tests

Curious how everything gets tested automatically?

Take a look at the [checker/](./checker/) folder.


## ‚úÖ GitHub Actions | CI Pipeline

No test suite is complete without **Continous Integration**.

I've set up the automated checker with **GitHub Actions**
to run tests on every push and pull request.

Take a look at the CI workflow here:
[.github/workflows/checker-tests.yml](.github/workflows/checker-tests.yml).
